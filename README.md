##getting help
So you need help.

People can help you, but first help them help you, and don't waste their time.

Provide a complete description of the issue.

If it works on A but not on B and others have to ask you: "so what is different between A and B" you are wasting everyone's time.

"hello", "please" and "thanks" are not swear words.
